ECG image classification using deep learning

ECG image features along with deep learning approaches have the potential to predict the disease outcomes. The identification of Parkinson Disease-specific physiomarkers and predictive models from ECG can be evaluated. Develop a model to differentiate different classes of disease and controls.
